This file will explain what's Fabric, how to use Fabric, Nginx and many other things necessary for the deployement of our first fully working site.

### What's Fabric
    .Fabric is a Python library (i.e. a tool to build on) used for interacting with SSH and computer systems [easily] to automate a wide range of tasks, varying from application deployment to general system administration.
    .Albeit being Python-based, it does not mean that it is used strictly for working with other Python applications or tools. In fact, Fabric is there for you to achieve just about anything regardless of a specific language or a system. As long as the very basic requirements are met, you can take advantage of this excellent library.
    .Fabric scripts are basic Python files. They are run using the fab tool that is shipped with with Fabric. All this does is include (i.e. import ..) your script (i.e. instructions to perform) and execute the provided procedure.
