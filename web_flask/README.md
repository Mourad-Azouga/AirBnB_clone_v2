In this project we'll set a flask web framework to our hbnb website.
Let's start with the Glossary

## Glossary
        .Web Framework - A piece of software that offers a way to create and run web applications. Thus, you donâ€™t need to code on your own and look for probable miscalculations and faults. More on them [here](https://intelegain-technologies.medium.com/what-are-web-frameworks-and-why-you-need-them-c4e8806bd0fb)

        .Flask - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions, check HowToFlask.md for more info.
    
        .Jinja2 -  A full-featured template engine for Python. It has full unicode support, an optional integrated sandboxed execution environment, widely used and BSD licensed. More on Jinja2 [here](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/)
